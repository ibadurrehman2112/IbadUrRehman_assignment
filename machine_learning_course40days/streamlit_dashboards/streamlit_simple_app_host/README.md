# Streamlit-WebApps
Streamlitâ€™s open-source app framework is the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps. It's very easy and I feel it makes the process of trying put parameters of a particular model much more faster by directly comparing the accuracies.

The code included in this repository allows us to toggle between three datasets: iris, wine and breast cancer datset. It also allows us to switch between three classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine. We can even change some of the parameters with the help of sliders.

As we can see it performs real time predictions and shows the accuracy.

In order to run the python files, just type 

streamlit run [file_name] in the terminal
